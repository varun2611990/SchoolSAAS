## Database Design Highlights

### Multi-Tenancy Implementation
- Workspace-based isolation ensures complete data separation
- Row-level security through workspace filtering
- Shared user model with workspace-specific roles

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Flexible Academic Structure**: Support for multiple academic years, classes, and sections
2. **Comprehensive User Management**: Support for all school stakeholders
3. **Financial Integration**: Built-in fee management with Stripe integration
4. **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps on all entities
5. **Soft Deletes**: `isActive` flags for data preservation

### Performance Considerations
- Indexed foreign keys for fast lookups
- Composite unique constraints for data integrity
- Efficient relationship modeling to minimize N+1 queries

## Security Features

### Data Isolation
- Workspace-based multi-tenancy
- Row-level security policies
- API middleware for workspace validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- NextAuth.js for secure authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT tokens for session management

### Data Protection
- Encrypted sensitive data
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Regular security updates

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="..."
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_..."
```

### Database Setup
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db seed
```

### Production Deployment
